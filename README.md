# Interpretable-by-design deep survival analysis for disease progression modeling

### Accepted at MICCAI 2024

This repository contains the code for the paper "Interpretable-by-design Deep Survival Analysis for Disease Progression Modeling". The code is based on PyTorch and is used to train and evaluate a deep learning model for survival analysis on fundus images. The model offers built-in interpretability by yielding an evidence map of local disease risk which is subsequently simply aggregated to a final risk prediction. The model is based on a combination of a Sparse BagNet and a Cox proportional hazards model. As a sample use case, it is trained to predict the risk of conversion to age-related macular degeneration at different time points and its performance is compared to that of black-box SOTA baseline models.

## Pre-requisites

- Obtain the AREDS data (see [Data](#data))
- Install the conda environment using `conda env create -f requirements.yml` (or use `requirements_without_R.yml` which installs much faster but lacks AUPRC metric support) and activate it with `conda activate amd-surv`.
- Log in to [wandb](https://wandb.ai) with the command `wandb login`. Create an account if you don't have one.

## Load and evaluate the pre-trained interpretable-by-design survival model on AREDS data

- Retrieve the model weights `7ufjvvnz_best.pth` from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10787031?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsImlhdCI6MTcwOTczNTcxMSwiZXhwIjoxNzI4OTUwMzk5fQ.eyJpZCI6ImY4MzNhYWMxLTA1MDMtNGY4YS04ZDI0LWRlNGZjODIzYTdhMyIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiI1ZTRjNTU3MWRiMTM1MzY2YTgyNDYwOTliYjYxOTQ1MSJ9.Qzh_-DCP6G_K2FgWz2lzn26GR3ojEf4r3k16lJmP73ZQNMJR_cvV8h321ggIQ46OtrMzQaOqLNclRfrEniSm7w) and place it in the `checkpoints` directory.
- Follow the instructions in `evaluate_survival.ipynb` to load the model and evaluate it.
- To evaluate the pre-trained baseline models, retrieve the other weights files and repeat the procedure.

## Alternatively, train the model yourself

The model can be trained and evaluated using the following command: <br>
`python train_and_evaluate_survival.py --config configs/sparsebagnet_cox.yml` <br>

Similarly, the baseline models can be trained and evaluated using the files in `configs/babenko/` and `configs/yan/`. The model configs serve to train one model for each inquired point in time (years 1 to 5).

## Modify the configuration

The training is configured using a yaml file. The following parameters can be set:
<details>

<summary>YAML</summary>

```yaml
# Path to the metadata csv file relative to the project directory.
metadata_csv: data/metadata_surv.csv    # input file with image paths etc. Make sure to select one with stereo images if selecting use_stereo_images: true below.

# Path to image files, relative to the data directory in dirs.yml.
image_dir: images-f2-1024px

The model takes below 12h to train and evaluate on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

Upon request, the AREDS data can be accessed from the [dbGaP repository](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000001.v3.p1). The tabular data needs to be parsed to one metadata file with the rows representing individual macula-centered (F2) images. <!--Throughout the study, two identifiers for participants have been used. Match participants to ID2 identifiers using the mapping file that comes with the AREDS data. <br>-->

The AREDS data directory as defined in `configs/dirs.yml` should contain:<br>
- a folder as set the model config (`image_dir`), the directory of image data. The images should be organized such that the metadata CSV image paths map to the image files, relative to the `image_dir`. <br>

The `<project>/data` directory should contain the following files:<br>
- `metadata_surv.csv`: Survival metadata table that maps screening data (event, duration) to image records. An example entry is provided in `data/metadata_surv example.csv` with important columns as follows:
  <details>

  <summary>Columns</summary>

  - patient_id, the eye identifier
  - visit_number, VISNO
  - image_eye, right or left eye
  - image_field, F2
  - image_side, RS or LS
  - image_file, file name
  - image_path, relative path incl. file name from data dir specified in `dirs.yml`
  - duration, relative time to the first visit where late AMD was diagnosed in units of visits (half years)
  - event, 1 if any record of this eye converted to late AMD, 0 else
  - diagnosis_amd_grade_12c, AMDSEVRE and AMDSEVLE: the AMD severity scale score starting at 0

  </details>

<ul><li><code>metadata_surv_stereo.csv</code>: Image metadata table with the same structure, but of records where both views (LS and RS) exist (for Babenko et al. baseline model).</li></ul><br>

Both datasets can be created from a parsed AREDS metadata file using `save_survival_metadata.ipynb`.
